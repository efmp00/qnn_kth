# Replication of the paper "Optimization Techniques of Quantum Neural Network for Image Classification"

Repository containing the code used to train a vanilla Quantum Neural Network. This project is part of an assignment for the Deep Learning in Data Science course at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. 

### Pending tasks
- [X] Fix the bug "FutureWarning: Calling float on a single element Series is deprecated and will raise a TypeError in the future"
- [ ] Review the original paper and understand the details
- [ ] Make a plan B for the data used to train the model
- [ ] (Optional) Implement CUDA
